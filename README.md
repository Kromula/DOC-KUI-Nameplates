KUI Nameplate Profile and Target Helper Imports

KUI Nameplates is a World of Warcraft nameplate addon that I use. While Plater is a popular addon, I find it has too much performance impacts in a Mythic raid environment, so I tend to go with KUI. 

Target Helper is an additional addon that can be used with KUI Nameplates. It allows you to add specific abilities, casts or Units, with different colors to help with prioritisation. This is most popularly used in Mythic+ but also useful in Raid environments for priority targets.
